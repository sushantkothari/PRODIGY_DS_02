#  Task: Titanic Survival Prediction
##  Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the steps to extract and analyze the Titanic dataset, load the data, and perform basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of variables and identify potential issues.

### Step 1: Extract the Zip File
Description
The first step involves extracting the Titanic dataset from a zip file. This is done using the ZipFile module from Python's built-in zipfile library.

The extracted files are train.csv, test.csv, and gender_submission.csv.
### Step 2: Load the Data
Description
The second step involves loading the datasets into Pandas DataFrames.

# Load the datasets

The datasets are loaded into train_df, test_df, and gender_submission_df DataFrames.
Step 3: Understanding The Data
Description
This step involves inspecting the data to understand its distribution and identify potential issues.

The output includes the first few rows of each dataset, summary statistics, and the count of missing values.

## Conclusion
This repository demonstrates the steps to extract and analyze the Titanic dataset, load the data, and perform basic exploratory data analysis. The code is designed to be easy to follow and understand, making it a useful resource for anyone looking to work with the Titanic dataset.
